1. TCP Communcation Layer between Homestation Software and Main Computer

All messages will be in the following format and should always fit within 1 packet of data.

|<---header--->|<------------data-------------->|

The maximum size of any message is 512 Bytes (including the header).

The header will always be read first, followed by the data.

EXAMPLE:
<kys message>
66603KYS
^^^^^    header
     ^^^ data
	 
Header:
Currently the header will always be a fixed size of 5 bytes and will contain the Message ID and the size of the data that follows in the tcp buffer.

Bytes 1-3:  Message ID (MID)
Bytes 4-5:  Size of attached data

Data:
This is a dynamically sized set of data that follows the header.  The size of this data must match the size defined in the header (see error checking).

The data does not necessarily have to be a character array.  Could be binary / hex if applicable.

Message ID (MID):

When the 3 character bytes are converted into digits, the MID will be 3 digit a signed integer value between -99-999.

This will provide the reader the information needed to know what type of data is being recieved.


MID Table:

-99 - -01:  Error Messages
000 - 099:  Info Messages
100 - 199:  Home Station Software to Main Computer messages
200 - 299:  Main Computer to Home Station Software messages
666	     :  Main Computer Terminate command
